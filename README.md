I apologize in advance for this repo, This repository in particular was my first real exposure to program & file structure. 
What it does:
- Creates a simple login UI
- the first entry sets the password and username as a new user
- it checks the password that was set against a password qualification service I set up
- Checks if the users have been set before

This was ambitious as the assignment given by my professor did not require user status or any fancy UI In particular with errors. But I felt that I could do it! I did make it work.
But this was my first entrance to having a neat file structure and organized models in an IDE and although I could have done a better job I believe that I had to start somewhere and I 
Did it well! :)
